# Similarity-Check-API
This is a demo which displays the working of the FastAPI python module. A BERT model is used to process two sentences and give the similarity score between them. 
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard type hints. Another python modeule named Uvicorn is used, FastAPI applications require an isolated environment to manage its dependencies such as Uvicorn which is an Asynchronous GateWay Server Interface server. 
The BERT model used in this code is "bert-base-nli-mean-tokens", It uses 128 input tokens, rather than 512.
